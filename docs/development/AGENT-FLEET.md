# Assigning the Unio agent fleet

Read this at lead startup alongside [routing](LEAD-ROUTING.md),
[effort](MODEL-EFFORT.md), [roles](../ai/MODEL-ROLES.md) and the
[task-fit scoreboard](MODEL-SCOREBOARD.md). This is an assignment guide,
not an automatic scheduler or proof that an account has allowance left.
The account inventory below was checked on 2026-10-10. Current owner
instructions and fresher observations take precedence.

## Give each account useful work

| Account route | Best starting assignment | Controls and boundaries |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Existing Codex lead | Plan, delegate, inspect actual changes, integrate and preserve handoffs | Keep one existing lead session. Low tier does not permit another independent Codex job on that account. |
| Claude Code / Opus 5.5 | Substantial implementation, UI interaction, stateful corrections and bounded architecture work | High normally; supported xhigh only when justified. Check owner holds and current account availability. |
| Grok | Nuanced control logic, security reasoning and precise failure analysis | Owner-preferred reasoning worker when available; high normally. A historical quota failure is dated evidence. |
| Antigravity / Gemini 3.1 Pro | Mechanical implementation with clear inputs, outputs and checks | Pin the high model and high effort. This route exposes high/low, not xhigh. Recent work needed lead corrections; keep assignments bounded. |
| Mistral Vibe / GLM 5.3 | Implementation from a concrete contract, including more involved code | Explicit GLM/high pin. Use existing monthly subscription; task estimates do not measure remaining allowance. |
| Mistral Vibe / Medium 3.5 | Smaller implementation or mechanical corrections when GLM is busy or unsuitable | Same Mistral budget as GLM: queue behind it in low tier. No fair checked ranking between the two yet. |
| Perplexity Pro / GLM 5.3 Thinking | Research, integration plans and supplementary code analysis using selected public context | Proposal only. Its matched plan separated occupied slots from quota more clearly; this is a small sample. |
| Perplexity Pro / Kimi K3 Thinking | Quick draft functions, small proposed patches and a complementary view of supplied code | Proposal only. Faster in one matched batch; both models generated faulty test fixtures. Independently check proposed code and tests. |
| GitHub Copilot Free / Auto Balance | Documentation drafts, inventories and small mechanical code proposals | New routine proposal route, pending actual trial evidence. Balance is routing, not effort or a fixed AI lab. Local/BYOK models are excluded. |
| OpenCode Go | Available GLM 5.3, Qwen 3.8, Kimi K3 or other explicitly approved capable routes for implementation | Use Go only, never a paid Zen counterpart. Models share the Go account budget; an old reset estimate proves no current capacity. |
| Verified-free OpenCode Zen pool | Documentation, formatting, inventories, boilerplate and predefined supplementary checks | Routine workers only. Verify current official/native zero input, output and cache prices; pin primary and helpers. Never lead or own main features. |

These assignments use current owner preferences and completed Unio work,
not advertised benchmark scores. Copilot's Free plan is an account tier;
it does not establish the reasoning ability or identity of Auto's selected
model. Start it on small work and widen its scope only with checked results
and owner policy. The [free inventory](../FREE-MODELS.md) covers all eleven
approved Zen candidates and exact routes; Exo still needs local eligibility.
Keep local models unused on this machine under the owner's current rule.

## Plan a small batch rather than a model race

For a functional milestone, give one capable implementation worker a
concrete change. Meanwhile, a different account can draft documentation or
research a relevant question if that work is independently useful. Scripts
can run deterministic inventories and checks without an AI session. Do not
create busywork or eleven-way benchmarks to keep every model occupied.

For example, Vibe GLM can implement a bounded save-retention correction,
while Copilot drafts its operator explanation from a supplied contract.
Perplexity can analyze a specific unresolved question if the implementation
actually needs it. The lead checks the real patch and test evidence under
the chosen work mode. This example is not an instruction to launch those
jobs without first freezing their tasks and checking account slots.

A research response or proposed patch is not a completed implementation.
A capable implementation worker or the existing lead checks, applies and
validates suitable proposals in its own worktree. Generated tests need
independent scrutiny. The [matched Perplexity report](PERPLEXITY-FIELD-TRIALS-2026-10-10.md)
shows why successful delivery and test authorship are separate from correctness.

## Group by allowance, not by model name

Low tier permits one independent native workflow per shared account,
including a registered lead. Give all aliases using one subscription the
same budget label with `unio account`. The actual alias must match the
prefix before the first hyphen in its worker name.

| Budget label example | Aliases that belong together |
| --- | --- |
| `codex` | All sessions using that Codex subscription, including the lead |
| `claude` | Claude Code aliases on that Claude subscription |
| `grok` | Grok aliases on that Grok subscription |
| `antigravity` | Models reached through that Antigravity allowance |
| `mistral` | Vibe GLM and Medium 3.5 aliases on the same subscription |
| `perplexity` | Perplexity GLM, Kimi and other approved routes on that Pro account |
| `copilot` | Copilot aliases using that GitHub account |
| `opencode` | Go and free Zen aliases using the same OpenCode account unless separate allowances are established |

GLM through Vibe and GLM through Perplexity do not automatically share
allowance. Conversely, different model names inside one subscription do
not create separate budgets. Groups enforce workflow concurrency, not
current quota. Unmanaged sessions remain uncounted: respect known owner
activity elsewhere. Never merge unrelated accounts solely because their
models come from the same AI lab.

## Before each assignment

1. Read the newest owner instructions, scoreboard and capacity observation.
   Check `unio policy` and current native jobs; availability can be Unknown.
2. Choose a task-fitting route with owner-approved funding. Freeze model or
   Auto profile, supported effort, scope, checks and task-sized deadline.
3. Map its alias to the actual shared budget. Run `unio resume`, then one
   authorized `unio run`; close the batch with `unio stop`.
4. Preserve commits, drafts, failures and receipts. Review the actual result;
   a zero exit or model self-report does not establish acceptance.
5. Update the scoreboard with task, route, settings, observed outcome and
   rework. Keep operational failures separate from code-quality findings.

Start at high or the supported middle; xhigh is the ceiling. No max/ultra,
paid fallback, topups or billing changes. Thinking is a route switch, not
an adjustable effort scale. Auto Balance does not pin the underlying lab,
so it cannot establish independent cross-lab review by itself. If a worker
struggles, use one suitable replacement, then the existing lead finishes;
never loop through weaker workers or duplicate the lead's account session.

## Setup and evidence

- [Optional integrations](../integrations/README.md): installed Vibe and
  Perplexity adapters; source Copilot setup as documented there.
- [Copilot Free / Balanced](../integrations/GITHUB-COPILOT.md): native route,
  exclusions, private proposal receipts and current trial status.
- [Capacity and freshness](CAPACITY-READINGS.md): remaining allowance is
  Unknown unless a supported observation or dated owner reading supplies it.
- [Model experience](MODEL-EXPERIENCE.md): future automatic task-fit profiles;
  the current guide and scoreboard are instructions, not runtime scoring.
