# Unio — Your AIs, in sync.

Unio brings AI agents from different AI labs together to build and improve
your project. A lead delegates the work, other agents review the changes,
and you stay in control.

## What Unio Does

- **Bring your AI agents into one team.** Connect agents from different AI
  labs through tools such as Claude Code, Codex, Grok, Antigravity and
  OpenCode. Give them a shared workspace for your project.
- **Give one AI agent the lead.** The lead turns your goal into manageable
  tasks, chooses workers and delegates the work. It coordinates their next
  steps within the plan you have approved.
- **Work on several tasks at once.** Workers can build separate parts of
  the project in parallel, each in its own copy. The lead moves independent
  tasks forward while other workers are busy, keeps related tasks in order
  and brings their results together for review.
- **Strengthen code and security with worker reviews.** AI agent workers
  from different AI labs can check one another's changes independently.
  Multiple review rounds help find bugs, security issues and ways to improve
  the code and product before you accept the work.
- **See what is finished and what needs attention.** Keep tasks, progress,
  checks and review findings together. See which changes passed their
  checks and which still need fixes or a decision.
- **Carry work forward when limits interrupt.** Clear handoffs record
  completed work, checks and next steps. The lead can pass the next task
  to another available agent when a session ends or an agent reaches its
  usage limit, reducing the need to explain the project again.
- **Keep control from start to finish.** You set the direction and decide
  how much freedom the lead has. Pause new work when needed, ask for changes
  and choose what becomes part of your project.

Read [how Unio assigns model roles](docs/ai/MODEL-ROLES.md): main implementation
agents build the features; verified-free workers handle routine support. Read
[how the lead keeps work moving](docs/development/PARALLEL-WORK.md): low tier
allows one workflow per shared account, while independent accounts work together.
The [model scoreboard](docs/development/MODEL-SCOREBOARD.md) helps it choose
workers from actual project results. If a worker and one suitable replacement
cannot finish, [the lead takes over](docs/ai/LEAD-ESCALATION.md) in its existing
session, preserving their work and the agreed checks.

**Available today:** a command-line tool for Linux, including Windows
through WSL, plus a [local browser workspace](bridge/README.md) in the source
archive. Use it to prepare and run tasks, follow worker output and inspect files.

*Install [Unio 0.5.3](https://github.com/danielmevit/unio/releases/tag/v0.5.3), the latest published release. See the [version plan](docs/VERSION-PLAN.md) for the next milestones.*

## A task, step by step

Say you want to add search to a small website:

1. **Describe it** to the lead AI: "Help people find an article by title."
2. **Approve the plan.** The lead splits the work into small tasks and says
   who does each one, which files may change, and how it will be checked.
3. **The helpers work**, each in a separate copy of the project, so their
   changes never get mixed up.
4. **The work is checked.** Unio runs the agreed checks and keeps
   the evidence. An agent from another AI lab can review the changes too.
5. **You decide.** Keep the changes, ask for fixes, or drop them. A
   finished AI run is not proof the work is right; the checks and your
   review are.

## Good to know

- Unio does not get around usage limits or pool subscriptions. Each
  tool keeps its own plan, limits, and terms.
- Switching AIs after a limit is supervised today: the next AI gets a
  written handoff, not the previous one's memory. Automatic continuation
  is on the roadmap.
- Helper AIs can run commands on your computer, and separate project copies
  are not a security sandbox. Use a spare Linux machine or virtual machine
  without important passwords or keys.
- AI tools send your prompts and code to their providers. Keep secrets out
  of tasks and repositories.

## Try it free (no AI calls)

### 1. Install and rehearse

You need Linux or WSL with Bash, Git, Python 3, and standard tools such as
`flock`. The rehearsal needs no AI account and uses no AI allowance.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielmevit/unio.git
cd unio
bash unio-install.sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
unio selftest
```

The self-test runs the whole workflow with pretend AIs in a temporary
project. The command is `unio`. The
installer puts commands in `~/.local/bin` and settings in
`~/.config/unio`; the [setup guide](docs/SETUP.md) shows how to keep the
PATH change for future terminals.

### 2. Choose your path

- **Show me the whole idea:** [take the worked-example tour](docs/EXAMPLE.md).
- **Walk me through setup:** [follow the complete guide](docs/GUIDEBOOK.md),
  including signing in to your AI tools.
- **I know terminals:** [use the compact setup reference](docs/SETUP.md).

### 3. Your first real task

Install and sign in to at least one AI coding tool. The included settings
cover Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, OpenCode, and Grok; use the ones you
have. Then try a project you do not mind experimenting on, for example
with Codex:

```bash
# Use your own Git repository URL; it needs at least one commit.
unio new YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL my-project codex
cd my-project/repo
unio doctor
unio agents
```

Open your favourite AI coding tool in `my-project/repo` and ask:

```text
Read MASTER.md and the project instructions. Read docs/ai/START_HERE.md
if present; use the supplied lead routing and effort guides before assigning
work. Help me plan one small change.
Check which workers are available, explain how you will test the result,
and wait for my approval before starting work. Do not merge for me.
```

Start with one helper and add another when you want a second perspective.
`agents` shows what is installed, not remaining quota or sign-in status.
`smoke` makes real test calls, so it uses some of your allowance.

 If your AI tool keeps asking before each `unio` command, or its own
 safety system refuses to run them, [allow those commands once](docs/SETUP.md#9-lead-ai-permissions)
 instead of switching its safety checks off. Unio's own refusals,
 such as `STOP is active`, say why in their message.

## Work modes and coordination budget

Two independent settings shape how the lead organizes work: the pace
(`yolo`, `medium`, `safe`) and the coordination budget (`low`, `medium`,
`high`: 1, 2 or 4 independent workflows per shared provider/account
budget, lead included). A larger subscription never requires a slower
workflow, and a smaller one should not exhaust the lead. See the
[work modes guide](docs/WORK-MODES.md):

```bash
unio mode yolo                    # coherent feature batches, focused checks, lead review
unio tier low                     # delegate to other providers; keep the lead on planning
unio lead codex                   # register the lead reservation in its budget group
unio account opencode go-primary  # aliases sharing one budget
unio policy                       # current state (--json for machines)
```

Available in Unio 0.5.3, these controls let you choose the pace and protect
shared subscription budgets. Unio counts its native worker and review workflows
and the registered lead. Sessions launched outside Unio remain uncounted.

New projects include instructions for the lead to read the active policy before
delegating. Verified-free OpenCode models handle routine support; they never
become the lead, main feature owner or final approver.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Do I have to pay for anything extra?</summary>

No. Unio is free and open source. It works with the AI plans you
already have, each signed in its own way, so you need no separate API keys.
The rehearsal (`unio selftest`) makes no AI calls at all. Real tasks use
your plans' normal allowance; optional extras, such as a second AI reviewing
the work, use a little more.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How is this different from calling the AI tools myself?</summary>

You can call any AI tool directly, and for a quick question that is fine.
Unio matters once AIs change your code:

| | Calling AI tools directly | Through Unio |
|---|---|---|
| Where the AI works | Wherever you point it; two at once can collide | Its own copy on its own branch |
| When it is "done" | When the AI says so | When the task's checks pass and only allowed files changed |
| Failures | Easy to miss | Recorded: a run that timed out stays "failed" |
| Reviews | An opinion | Tied to the exact version; a later change makes it stale |
| Memory | Lives in one chat | Files any AI or person can read and continue from |
| Safety | Each tool on its own | A stop switch, paused agents, one run per worker, time limits |

The AIs were always reachable. Unio makes their work isolated,
checked, recorded and easy to hand over.

Leads should read the [routing and spending policy](docs/development/LEAD-ROUTING.md)
and [model effort guide](docs/development/MODEL-EFFORT.md) before assigning work.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which AI tools do I need?</summary>

One is enough to start. Settings are included for Claude Code, Codex,
Antigravity, OpenCode (for models such as GLM and Kimi) and Grok. Any
command-line AI that can take a task without a chat window can join with
one line in `~/.config/unio/agents.conf`, for example
`mycli=mycli -p "$(cat "$TASKFILE")"`. Prefer a supported stdin or file
option for large tasks; see the [transport guidance](docs/SETUP.md). An
agent from another AI lab can review the work independently.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it work on Windows or Mac?</summary>

Linux, yes. Windows, yes, through WSL (Ubuntu works well). Mac is not
supported yet: Unio relies on Linux tools such as `flock`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do the AIs talk to each other?</summary>

Not directly, and they share no memory. They coordinate through files in
your project: task orders, reports, results and handoff notes. Each AI
starts fresh, reads what the others left, and writes down what it did, so
another AI can continue from those notes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is it safe? Will it change my project without asking?</summary>

Helpers are given their own copies on their own branches, and their work
reaches your main branch when you merge it. The lead AI works in your main
copy, so tell it not to merge for you (the starter prompt above does).
Nothing enforces those boundaries, though: every AI runs commands on your
computer with your rights, and the copies are not a security sandbox. Use
a spare Linux machine or virtual machine without important passwords or
keys, keep secrets out of tasks and repositories, and remember that each AI
sends your prompts and code to its provider. `unio stop` blocks new runs;
`unio kill T7` ends task T7 if it is running.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I know the AI's work is actually right?</summary>

Every task names the files it may change and the checks that must pass.
`unio verify` re-runs those checks and fails the task if one fails or
anything changed outside the allowed files; nothing is undone, so you can
inspect it. Once verify passes, `unio review` can ask an agent from another AI lab
to judge the committed change. The result records separately whether the
AI finished, the checks passed and the review approved. Your own decision
comes last: a finished run is never taken as proof the work is right.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens when an AI hits its usage limit?</summary>

Pause it and give the next task to an agent from another AI lab.
`unio off codex 5h` stops new tasks from going to Codex for five hours,
and `unio handoff codex T7` writes a context note about task T7: what
was done, what passed and what is left. The lead then gives the work to
another AI with that note. The note is context only: unfinished, uncommitted
changes stay in Codex's copy. [Handoff packets](docs/QUALITY-USAGE.md#handoff-packets)
explain the details. Unio does not get around limits or share plans;
each tool keeps its own. The upcoming v0.5.4 source now includes
[automatic recovery saves](docs/WORK-SAVING.md) before, during and after native
worker runs, plus manual restore. These preserve unfinished files without a
final AI answer. Authorized continuation and lead cooldown restart are still
pending. Published v0.5.3 handoffs provide context, without recovery snapshots.

</details>

<details>
<summary>My lead AI keeps asking for permission, or a run is refused. What now?</summary>

First check who refused. Unio's own refusals say why, for example
`STOP is active`, an agent that is `OFF`, or a worker that is
`already running a task`; `unio status` shows the state. If instead the
AI tool asks or refuses, that is its own safety system. For Claude Code,
allow the `unio` commands once in a small settings file and
restart it; [setup step 9](docs/SETUP.md#9-lead-ai-permissions) shows the
file and what it does and does not allow. Other tools have similar approval
settings. Do not add rules for pushes or merges into your main branch;
approve those yourself, one at a time. Turning all safety checks off is
only sensible on a throwaway virtual machine.

</details>

## For the curious and the nerdy

Unio is a Bash orchestration layer around existing coding CLIs, not
a new model or a hosted service. Each tool uses its own sign-in; there is no
shared API-key service.

- **Separate workspaces:** each worker gets a Git worktree on an
  `agent/NAME` branch. A worktree shares the repository's history; it is not
  an isolated virtual machine.
- **Explicit task contracts:** Markdown task files hold instructions,
  allowed paths, validation commands, and a definition of done.
- **Inspectable evidence:** diffs, append-only reports, live logs, a JSONL
  event ledger, and a revision-bound JSON result per task.
- **Cross-provider options:** independent reviews, competing attempts, and
  rotating bug hunts. They use extra provider capacity and are optional.
- **Availability controls:** bench a provider by hand or for a set time.
  Limit-message detection flags failed runs; it is not a quota meter.

For a layered review workflow, the lead can assign several reviewers from
different AI labs to the same complete change. Run their reviews independently
and compare findings before deciding what needs a correction. Each native
review records a decision for the exact task, base and committed change;
a later edit makes that evidence stale. The tool provides these checks and
records, while the lead coordinates additional review rounds.

Reviewers can disagree or miss the same defect. Use executable checks and
inspect actual evidence alongside their findings. More calls consume more
allowance; bounded tasks and written handoffs help avoid repeated work, but
lower total usage depends on the results. Automatic checkpoint recovery and
universal multi-review enforcement are not shipped features.

Everyday commands once a project is set up:

```bash
unio help             # discover commands
unio status           # tasks, reports, review queue, running work
unio tail             # follow the latest run's log
unio score            # per-worker scorecard from the event ledger
unio result codex T7  # stored run/verify/review evidence as JSON
unio handoff codex T7 # context packet for the next AI, same checkout
unio agents --json    # local availability; no login or quota probe
unio off codex 5h     # bench a provider for your chosen interval
unio on codex         # make it available again
```

A finished process, passing checks, a reviewer's approval, and your own
acceptance are separate results. `verify` exits 2 (INCOMPLETE) when a task
has no scope or Validate lines, and `review` runs only after a current
passing `verify`. `stop` blocks new runs; `kill TASK_ID` ends a running one.
Every exit code and field is in the [quality reference](docs/QUALITY-USAGE.md).

## What's next

- **Available, v0.5.3:** the browser workflow, worker output and files,
  work modes and shared subscription-budget controls. See the
  [release notes](CHANGELOG.md) and [browser guide](bridge/README.md).
- **Next, v0.5.4:** save unfinished work, restore it for continuation and
  restart an owner-enabled lead after its cooldown. Dark themes and the
  live work map are accepted in main for this release; recovery is being built.
- **Later:** remaining-allowance monitoring, more reliable connections and
  smarter delegation, guided by actual project outcomes.
